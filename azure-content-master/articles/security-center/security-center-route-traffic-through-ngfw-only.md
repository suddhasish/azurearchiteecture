# Route traffic through Next Generation Firewall only in Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center can detect when you have deployed a Next Generation Firewall (NGFW). If you have Internet-facing endpoints, Azure Security Center will recommend that you configure Network Security Group rules that force inbound traffic to your virtual machine (VM) through your NGFW.

> [AZURE.NOTE] This document introduces the service by using an example deployment. This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation

1. In the **Recommendations blade**, select **Route traffic through NGFW only**.
![Route traffic through NGFW only][1]

2. This opens the blade **Route traffic through NGFW only** which lists VMs that you can route traffic. Select a VM from the list.
![Select a VM][2]

3. A blade for the selected VM opens, displaying related inbound rules. A description provides you with more information on possible next steps.
![Configure rules to limit access][3]
