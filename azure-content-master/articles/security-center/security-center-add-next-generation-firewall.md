# Add a Next Generation Firewall in Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center may recommend that you add a next generation firewall (NGFW) from a Microsoft partner in order to increase your security protections. This document walks you through an example of how to do this.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The information in this document applies to the preview release of Azure Security Center. This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation

1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select **Add a Next Generation Firewall**.
![Add a Next Generation Firewall][1]

2. In the **Add a Next Generation Firewall** blade, select an endpoint.
![Select an endpoint][2]

3. A second **Add a Next Generation Firewall** blade opens. You can choose to use an existing solution if available or you can create a new one. In this example there are no existing solutions available so we'll create a new NGFW.
![Create new Next Generation Firewall][3]

4. To create a new NGFW, select a solution from the list of integrated partners. In this example we will select **Check Point**.
![Select Next Generation Firewall solution][4]

5. The **Check Point** blade opens providing you information about the partner solution. Select **Create** in the information blade.
![Firewall information blade][5]

6. The **Create virtual machine** blade opens. Here you can enter information required to spin up a virtual machine that will run the NGFW. Follow the steps and provide the NGFW information required. Select OK to apply.
![Create virtual machine to run NGFW][6]
