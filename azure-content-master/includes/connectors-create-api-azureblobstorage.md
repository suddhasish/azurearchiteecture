### Prerequisites

Before you use your Azure Blob Storage account in a logic app, authorize the logic app to connect to your Azure Blob Storage account. Fortunately, you can do this easily from within your logic app on the Azure  portal.  

Here are the steps to authorize your logic app to connect to your Azure Blob Storage account:  

1. To create a connection to Azure Blob Storage, in the Logic app designer, select **Show Microsoft managed APIs** in the drop down list then enter *Azure Blob Storage* in the search box. Select the trigger or action you'll like to use:

2. If you haven't created any connections to Azure Blob Storage before, you'll get prompted to provide your Azure Blob Storage credentials. These credentials will be used to authorize your Logic app to connect to, and access your Azure Blob Storage account's data:
